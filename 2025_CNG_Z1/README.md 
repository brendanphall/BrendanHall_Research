## Features

These interactive visualizations allow you to:
- Hover over nodes to see relation details
- Pan and zoom to explore graph structure
- See the dual encoding system (color + shape) in action
- Compare different neighborhood types side by side

## About the Visualizations

The figures demonstrate three types of conceptual neighborhood graphs:

- **Translation Neighborhoods (Figures 9-11)**: Show B-Type neighborhoods at different scales (Z=1, 2, 3), demonstrating size-restricted groupings where small relations connect only to small relations.

- **Isotropic Neighborhood (Figure 12)**: Shows the C-Type (scaling) neighborhood with symmetric structure and cross-group connections.

- **Anisotropic Neighborhood (Figure 13)**: Shows the A-Type neighborhood with asymmetric scaling properties.

- **Combined View (Figure 14)**: Presents multiple neighborhood types for direct comparison.

## Encoding System

Each node uses dual encoding:
- **Color**: Represents Allen relation family (Disjoint, Meet, Overlap, Start, During, Finish, Equal)
- **Shape**: Represents interior properties (open/closed endpoints)
