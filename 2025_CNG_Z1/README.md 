## Features

These interactive visualizations allow you to:
- Hover over nodes to see relation details
- Pan and zoom to explore graph structure
- See the dual encoding system (color + shape) in action
- Compare different neighborhood types side by side

## Encoding System

Each node uses dual encoding:
- **Color**: Represents Allen relation family (Disjoint, Meet, Overlap, Start, During, Finish, Equal)
- **Shape**: Represents interior properties (open/closed endpoints)
